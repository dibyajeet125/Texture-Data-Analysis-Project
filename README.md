# Texture-Data-Analysis-Project
The Texture Data Analysis Project showcases the effectiveness of SQL in extracting actionable insights from complex product sales datasets. This project involved a thorough examination of sales data to uncover key metrics that can inform business strategies and enhance decision-making processes. The analysis focused on several critical areas, beginning with identifying the top-selling products. By analyzing sales volume, we were able to pinpoint which items performed best, enabling businesses to optimize their inventory and marketing strategies around these high-demand products.

Key Insights:
The project also included a detailed revenue analysis, which provided a clear view of gross revenue without discounts, illustrating the business's earning potential prior to any promotional activities. Additionally, we assessed the impact of discounts by calculating the total discount offered, which illuminated how much businesses invest in customer incentives and how this affects pricing strategies. Understanding customer behavior was another focal point; we tracked unique transactions and evaluated the average number of products purchased per transaction, yielding valuable insights into purchasing patterns.
To further understand the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, we calculated the average discount per transaction, allowing businesses to measure their impact on sales. A comparison of revenue between members and non-members quantified the value of loyalty programs, revealing how membership influences purchasing behavior. Identifying the top revenue-generating products was also crucial; by focusing on the three products contributing most significantly to revenue, businesses can prioritize these items in their marketing efforts.

Segment Performance and Techniques:
The analysis extended to evaluating sales across different product segments, providing a roadmap for targeted growth strategies tailored to specific market segments. The project employed various SQL techniques, including joins and aggregations, which facilitated merging datasets and aggregating metrics for deeper insights. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) simplified complex calculations, resulting in cleaner and more manageable queries. Logical database design with normalized tables ensured accuracy and efficiency throughout the querying process.
